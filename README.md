# RPBot9000

A twitch/discord bot to record bans in a channel and log them in a discord server.


## USAGE

#### Discord:
Bans on a Twitch channel will be reported to the specified channel in botconfig.chatBans
To have the bot join your channel, use /join in the channel specified in botconfig.botChannel

#### Twitch:
The bot will never say anything in a Twitch channel. It will only listen for ban events then report them in Discord.

#### Warning:
Under no circumstances should you ever add the bot to someones Twitch channel without their express permission. This is a violation of the Twitch TOS. Also under no circumstances should you take this code and implement a method to cross-ban users in multiple channels. This is also against the Twitch TOS. Violating the Twitch TOS will result in a permanant ban from all of Twitch.
